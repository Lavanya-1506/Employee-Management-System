# Employee-Management-System
This is a React-based Employee Management System with role-based login for Admin and Employees. The Admin dashboard allows task assignment and displays a table showing each employeeâ€™s task status counts (Completed, New, Active, Failed). The Employee dashboard shows assigned tasks along with a summary of task counts, helping track progress clearly. The system ensures organized task management with separate views and controls for each user role.
